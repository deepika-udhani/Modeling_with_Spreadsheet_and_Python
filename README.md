The projects undertaken in this coursework were aimed at applying various modeling techniques to solve real-world decision-making problems.

Exponential Distribution Simulation:
Implemented simulation techniques to model scenarios involving exponential distributions.
Explored how these simulations can be used to make informed decisions in situations where random events follow an exponential pattern.

Optimization with Single and Multiple Variables:
Applied optimization techniques using Excel Solver and genetic algorithm Solver Table to maximize or minimize objective functions.
Explored scenarios with both single and multiple decision variables to identify optimal solutions for complex problems.

Probability Simulation:
Utilized simulation methods to model probabilistic outcomes and assess the likelihood of different events occurring.
Examined how probability simulations can aid decision-making by providing insights into uncertain situations.

Simulation with Decision Variables:
Developed simulation models incorporating decision variables to analyze the impact of different choices on outcomes.
Explored decision-making under uncertainty by simulating various scenarios and evaluating their consequences.

Overall, these projects provided hands-on experience in using modeling techniques such as optimization and simulation to analyze data, evaluate alternatives, and make informed decisions. They helped bridge the gap between theoretical concepts learned in class and their practical application in solving real-world problems.
